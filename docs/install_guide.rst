Installation Guide
==================

macOS and Linux users
---------------------

To install the DynaSig-ML package, simply type::

	pip install dynasigml

inside your terminal.

If you want to make sure the underlying NRGTEN package works well, type::

	git clone https://github.com/gregorpatof/nrgten_examples

Followed by::

	cd nrgten_examples
	python simple_test.py

And you should see this appear in your terminal::

	NRGTEN is properly installed on your system!

Congratulations, you have now installed both the DynaSig-ML and NRGTEN packages. Everything described
in this guide will work on your machine.

.. note::

	DynaSig-ML requires Python version 3.6 or greater to work. If your default Python installation is Python 2.x, you will need
	to use **pip3** instead of **pip** and **python3** instead of **python**.

Windows users
-------------

If you already are a user of NRGTEN, you can install DynaSig-ML as described above. If not, you will need to follow
the instructions to install NRGTEN on Windows here: https://nrgten.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install_guide.html#windows-users
